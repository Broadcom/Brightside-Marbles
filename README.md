# Brightside-Marbles
This repository will host a sample application project that involves both mainframe and distributed components. Our intention will be to showcase how CA Brightside can be used to easily enable the use of tools like Gulp, Mocha, and Jenkins to build, test and orchestrate z/OS interaction. The purpose of this repository is to offer education on how CA Brightside can be effectively used.

CA Brightside is a command line interface that enables interaction with the z Platform from a client machine. For information on features and how to install (click ‘Install Community Edition’): https://www.ca.com/us/products/ca-brightside.html
